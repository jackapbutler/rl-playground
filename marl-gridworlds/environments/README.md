# Multi-Agent-Learning-Environments
Hello, I pushed some python environments for Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning. Some are single agent version that can be used for algorithm testing. I provide documents for each environment, you can check the corresponding pdf files in each directory. These are just toy problems, though some of them are still hard to solve. Some environments are like:

## Dependency
OpenCV, swig


## Multi-Agent Environment Standard

**Assumption:**

Each agent works synchronously.


**Member Functions**

reset()

reward_list, done = step(action_list)

obs_list = get_obs()



reward_list records the single step reward for each agent, it should be a list like [reward1, 	reward2,......]. The length should be the same as the number of agents. Each element in the 	list should be a integer.

done True/False, mark when an episode finishes.

<font color=Blue>action_list</font> records the single step action instruction for each agent, it should be a list like [action1, 	action2,...]. The length should be the same as the number of agents. Each element in the 	list should be a non-negative integer.

<font color=Blue>obs_list</font> records the single step observation for each agent, it should be a list like [obs1, obs2,...]. The length should be the same as the number of agents. Each element in the 	list can be any form of data, but should be in same dimension, usually a list of variables or 	an image.


**Typical Monte Carlo Procedures**

reset environment by calling reset()
get initial observation get_obs()
for i in range(max_MC_iter):
  get action_list from controller
  apply action by step()
  record returned reward list
  record new observation by get_obs()
